							<p>Hello! my name is Christopher Ruiz Cortes. I am from Santa Maria, California and decided to come and study at California Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly) because of the opportunity it provided me. I am majoring in Computer Science because I like everything about it from Web Development to embedded systems to security. I also like to play video games and being active aswell as nature.

					<div class="about-text">
							<p>I made this website with the help of the Hack4Impact Starter Pack as part of my admission process which I hope to get into. I chose to do Computer Science here at Cal Poly because of the chance that Cal Poly provides which is learn by doing! I learned of Computer Science from high school as a career path that I got to pick and that is what stuck with me throughout. Really enjoyed learning all about it but the thing that stuck with me the most is the security aspect of computers. I learned of networking through Cisco online courses and then started learning about security through binary exploitation videos on youtube and learned more on my own devices. As a first year student I am working on getting used to the college experience and my schedule and I plan to work on many personal projects throughout my time here at Cal Poly</p>

							<p>I like to play video games on my xbox one.Although I have dont play as much as I used to than when I was younger due to the time demand that school and life have token away. I grew up playing the <em>Halo</em>Franchise up to today. If you were to ask me anything about the game and franchise. I am confident I could answer it. Today I spend most of my time taking care of my four pet budgies that I have. Everyday before I go to school I make sure they have everything they need and when I get back I let them out of their room so they can fly around in my living room. They like to hang out in high places like the ceiling fan Although three of them can't fly so I have to help them get up. They still have clipped wings from when I bought them but am sure they will be flying laps around my room when they get their wings. I plan on making them a large aviary when we grow up so they have lots of place to fly. </p>
