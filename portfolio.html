					<p class="project-name">Personal Website</p>
					<p class="project-description">I made this very site using the Hack4Impact Start Pack hosted by github.<br>This helped me learn many things including how to use git through the cli. This also made me realize that having a personal website can be very useful in the cyber industry as it allows me to furhter show my skills and traits. I will definately build upon this foundation further in the future.</p>

					<p class="project-name">Zydis Disassembler</p>
					<p class="project-description">I made a disassembler in C by wrapping the <a href="https://github.com/zyantific/zydis">Zydis Engine</a>.<br>I made a cli app that would take in a input file and use the linux inotify syscall to track that input files state. Whenever the file would be updated the Engine was called on the file after parsing. The output would then be printed to stdin. I made this to learn about opcodes for the x86-64 architecture. I learned how to make basic elf binaries and learning opcodes would make coding in and debugging the code segment faster and easier. This overall helped me learn about elf binaries, binary enumeration, and binary exploitation. This was also what led to my inspiratin of another project which was in making a debugger.</p>
